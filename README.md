# vue-SOS
### A simple SOS game created using vue.js
## Setup
Clone the code locally, then run:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies.

To play around with the code in development mode, run:
```
npm run dev
```

To build the code for production, run:
```
npm run build 
```

Note that you need a server to preview the production build. You can use ``serve`` for this as follows:
```
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist
```
